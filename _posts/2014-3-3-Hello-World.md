## MalwareTech Ransomware1 Reversing challenge:

I was looking into the RE challenges posted by MalwareTech on his website found [here][https://www.malwaretech.com/beginner-malware-reversing-challenges]. They deal with finding a flag in the Binaries in the form of **FLAG{}**. I solved all of them but the last [one][https://www.malwaretech.com/ransomware1], it dealt with a simple Ransomware sample that Encrypts some files with it's custom algorithm. With the zip file came a __flag.txt_encrypted__ :
