title: Write-up on Reversing a Credentials Stealer (Part 1)
---

I recently had my hands on a malware sample that came with a malicious e-mail attachment. Upon reversing it I found out it employed various facets of Windows Programming to steal Barclay's Bank credentials from an unsuspecting user. It took advantage of Windows GUI programming flexibility to insert a Window inside the clipboard chain to log user clipboard data. It also extensively used the COM framework to determine the user behaviour and accordingly steal userâ€™s data. The malware definitely warrants a entry in this personal Malware Analysis write-up blog.

The file that I renamed as 'mal.fil' is a simple PE file that can be opened with a PE viewer tool like PE Bear.

If we take a look at the sections, we can clearly see this is a file packed with UPX packers as indicated by the sections names UPX0, UPX1..
